# Using the Dashboard

The Next.js dashboard located in `dashboard_ui/` provides live charts and a chat interface.

Run it locally with:
```bash
cd dashboard_ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

After building (`npm run build && npm run export`) the static files are served from `/dashboard/ui` in the API server.
