# Dockerfile and Deployment Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created New Dockerfile** (`/brainstackstudio/Dockerfile`)
- **WORKDIR**: Set to `/app` where the application code will live
- **Source Directory**: Copies from `fastapi-operator-env/` which contains the working FastAPI application
- **Requirements**: Copies `fastapi-operator-env/requirements.txt` first for better Docker caching
- **CMD**: Updated to `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 2`
  - No subfolder prefix needed since main.py is in the root of WORKDIR
- **Health Check**: Configured to hit `/health` endpoint which exists in the application
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user `appuser`

### 2. **Created render.yaml** 
- Configured for Docker runtime deployment
- Points to the new Dockerfile in the root
- Includes all necessary environment variables
- Health check path set to `/health`
- Auto-deploy enabled for the main branch

### 3. **Removed Incorrect Files**
- Deleted `/brainstackstudio/main.py` which had incorrect imports (`apps.backend.*`)
- This file was trying to import from a non-existent directory structure

### 4. **Why This Works**
- The `fastapi-operator-env/` directory contains the complete, working FastAPI application
- It has the correct directory structure with:
  - `main.py` (entry point)
  - `codex/` (task modules)
  - `core/` (core functionality)
  - `db/` (database models)
  - `utils/` (utilities)
  - All imports in this codebase are correct and don't reference non-existent paths

## Key Points

1. **No /backend or /apps directory exists** - The code is directly in `fastapi-operator-env/`
2. **The Dockerfile now correctly**:
   - Sets WORKDIR to `/app`
   - Copies all source files from `fastapi-operator-env/` to `/app`
   - Runs `main:app` (not `apps.backend.main:app`)
3. **Health endpoint** already exists at `/health` in the FastAPI application

## Deployment

The changes have been pushed to the repository. Render should automatically:
1. Detect the new Dockerfile
2. Build the image with the correct structure
3. Start the FastAPI application successfully
4. Pass health checks

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are configured in Render:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`
- Other integration tokens as needed

The application should now deploy without ModuleNotFoundError!
