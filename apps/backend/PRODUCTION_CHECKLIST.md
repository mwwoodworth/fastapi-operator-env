## Production Deployment Requirements

### Infrastructure
- [ ] PostgreSQL database (currently using SQLite for tests)
- [ ] Redis for caching and session storage
- [ ] Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for embeddings
- [ ] Message queue (RabbitMQ/Redis) for async tasks

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
STRIPE_API_KEY=...
```

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Enable CORS restrictions
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Async task processing
- [ ] Load balancing configuration

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Application metrics (Prometheus)
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Configuration guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Integration examples

## Deployment Steps

1. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   python scripts/seed_data.py  # If initial data needed
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in all required environment variables
   - Validate configuration with health check

3. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker build -t brainops-backend .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env brainops-backend
   ```

4. **Production Server**
   - Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers
   - Configure nginx as reverse proxy
   - Set up SSL certificates
   - Enable systemd service

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Implementations**
   - AI agents return mock responses
   - Payment processing uses test mode
   - Some automation features are stubs

2. **Intentionally Skipped Tests (7)**
   - Complex workflow validation
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Advanced agent safety features
   - These are marked for post-launch implementation

3. **Technical Considerations**
   - Some endpoints use mock data for testing
   - File upload optimization pending
   - WebSocket support not yet implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Generate comprehensive test coverage report
   - Create deployment documentation
   - Set up staging environment
   - Implement health check endpoints

2. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Implement real AI agent integrations
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Set up monitoring infrastructure
   - Performance testing and optimization

3. **Long-term (1-2 months)**
   - Implement WebSocket support
   - Add advanced search with Elasticsearch
   - Implement data export/import features
   - Multi-tenant support
