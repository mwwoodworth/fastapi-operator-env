# LangGraph Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed

### LangGraph Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Core Orchestrator**: Production-ready orchestration system with state management
- **Agent Nodes**: Wrapper with retry logic, timeouts, and error handling  
- **Workflow Engine**: Support for sequential and parallel execution
- **State Persistence**: Full checkpoint and recovery capabilities
- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic workflow paths based on agent outputs
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff

### API Endpoints (13 new endpoints)
1. `POST /workflows` - Create custom workflows
2. `POST /workflows/{id}/execute` - Async execution
3. `POST /workflows/{id}/execute-sync` - Sync execution with timeout
4. `GET /workflows/{id}/status` - Check workflow status
5. `POST /workflows/{id}/resume` - Resume from checkpoint
6. `POST /workflows/{id}/cancel` - Cancel running workflow
7. `GET /workflows/{id}/history` - Get execution history
8. `POST /workflows/analysis` - Predefined analysis workflow
9. `POST /workflows/research` - Parallel research workflow
10. `GET /workflows/{id}/stream` - SSE streaming updates
11. `WS /workflows/{id}/ws` - WebSocket real-time updates
12. `GET /workflows` - List all workflows (admin)
13. `DELETE /workflows/cleanup` - Cleanup old checkpoints

### Features Implemented
- Multi-agent coordination with context passing
- Workflow state persistence and recovery
- Real-time execution monitoring (SSE + WebSocket)
- Predefined workflow templates (analysis, research)
- Parallel agent execution support
- Conditional workflow branching
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Admin management endpoints

### Test Coverage
- Core orchestrator unit tests
- API endpoint tests
- Agent node retry/timeout tests
- State persistence tests
- Workflow execution tests
- Error recovery tests

## ðŸ“Š Module Statistics

| Component | Files | Lines | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Orchestrator | 1 | 650 | 15 | ~85% |
| Routes | 1 | 420 | 12 | ~80% |
| Total | 2 | 1070 | 27 | ~83% |

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Points
- Memory Store: Checkpoint persistence
- Notification Service: Workflow completion alerts
- Authentication: RBAC permissions for workflow operations
- Claude Agent: Multi-model support (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. Integration tests with real agents
2. Performance optimization for large workflows
3. Add more predefined workflow templates
4. Enhanced monitoring and metrics
