## üö® Incident Response Procedures

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Complete outage, data loss risk
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature broken, significant degradation  
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature issues, some users affected
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, workarounds available

### Response Times
- **P0**: Immediate (page on-call)
- **P1**: Within 30 minutes
- **P2**: Within 2 hours
- **P3**: Next business day

### Escalation Path
1. **First Responder**: Check monitoring dashboards
2. **On-Call Engineer**: Investigate and attempt fix
3. **Technical Lead**: Major decisions, rollback approval
4. **Founder/CTO**: Business impact decisions

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### High Error Rate
```bash
# Check recent deployments
git log --oneline -10

# View error details in Sentry
# Check for pattern in errors

# If deployment-related, rollback:
./rollback_production.sh
```

#### Database Connection Errors
```bash
# Check connection pool
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Restart connection pool if needed
# Scale up database if at capacity
```

#### Memory Leaks
```bash
# Identify leaking service
docker stats

# Restart affected containers
docker restart brainops-backend-xxx

# Investigate with profiler if recurring
```
